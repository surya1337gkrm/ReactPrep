Writing Our First Test case.

Inside the test file, we need to import the functions we want 
to test and use test() method.

test method is provided by jest and it takes two params.
    a string to identify the test and a callback fn.

    without writing anything insdie the callback fn and running the tests
    will result in a success case. As test fn isn't expecting anything.

Every testcase should have an expectation [ Assertion ].
We need to use expect() method provided by jest inside callback fn.

    Example: expect(sum(2,5)).toBe(7)
             -> Here, we are testing sum fn to return '7' when 2,5 passed as args.

Unlike react files, we can't import anything inside test files directly using import statements.
We need to configure jest with babel in order to use import statements in test files.

    -> TO configure babel with jest, we need to install few packages as dev dependencies.

       npm i -D babel-jest @babel/core @babel/preset-env

    -> After Installing, we need to configure babel [ either use babel.config.js / .babelrc file ]
       
       Add the below line in .babelrc file.
        -> {
            "presets": [["@babel/preset-env", { "targets": { "node": "current" } }]]
            }
