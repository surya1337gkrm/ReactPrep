in order to use tailwind, we can add tailwind cdn url in our root html file
(<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>)
or
install tailwindcss & postcss npm packages and configure.

initialize tailwindcss by running the below command - npx tailwindcss init

- inside the tailwind.config.js file, for content property, we need to add the files where we might use our tailwind css classes.
  example: content: ['./src/**/*.{html,js,jsx}'],

  Note: talwind.config.css and .postcssrc should be in same directory

  and then create a postcssrc file to mention that we are using tailwind in our project.
