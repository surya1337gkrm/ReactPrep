So far we are just testing for the component to render and 
writing our test cases based on the UI elements.

Now we have to write test cases for the events that are fired from 
our components like typing/onChange/onClick etc.

If we have a text box and if we need to mock typing data in text field,
we need to fire a typing/onChange event. RTL provided fireEvent method.

    to fire an change event, use change method present on the fireEvent method
    fireEvent.change(<target element>,{})

    in our case target element will be our search input element.
    and like in our synthetic event onChange we receive value on changing 
    from event.target.value. so we need to simulate that.

        fireEvent.change(<target element>,{target:{
            value:{"Value we want to search"}
        }})

    
    simillarly, to fire a click event:
        fireEvent.click() can be used.

        fireEvent.click(searchBtn)
