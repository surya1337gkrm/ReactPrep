Whenever state changes, compoent renrenders and the the changes only will be updated in the component.

- useEffect Hook
    Component will be rendered and the useEffect will be called based on the dependency array.
    - If state changes & state is passed as an dependency array, component will be rendered first and then the 
      useEffect will be executed again.


Browsers will stop the api requests to cross origin requests. to avoid this error, use CORS Plugin.
    - Or, in the backend api, allow cors.



useState shouldnt be called inside loops/conditional statements. Also,
  useState shouldnt be used outside the functional component.
  as useState is a method provided by react to create a local state in fn component.
