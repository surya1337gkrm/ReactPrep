unlike nodejs/express, we don't need to install/require
'dotenv' library in our react application to read environment
variables.

in order to store and read environment variables [ helps us to 
hide sensitive information ] in react, create a .env file in the
root directory and store the data as key value pairs.

in create-react-app, values stored in .env should have the key value
starting with REACT_APP_<Varialble name>

    Example: REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY='KEY VALUE'

TO read this value in our component/application,
we need access this variable using process.env

    Example: process.env.REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY
