TreeShaking: Bundlers will remove the unnecessary code in out application 
    Like, removing unwanted/unused methods/functions of a library we installed in app.


npx is used to execute a package where as npm is used to install/run
    npm is simillar to 'npm run ...'


in package.json, there is a browserlists section. babel uses this data to transpile the code to support these browsers listed
    [ i.e, all browsers will be supported, but these listed browsers must be supported. these browsers will be tragetted first. 
        polyfills are written accordingly.]

JSX should only have one parent. So either wrap the jsx with a div/React.Fragment component(<></>)

When u build a realworld application, we need our application to be dynamic based on the location/info etc... Basically, a dynamic UI
    Data will be sent from thr backend api, so we should use this data and build the frontend based on the UI. which is called as
    "Config Driven UI/Dynamic UI"

_________________________________________________________________

In functional component, All the arguments passed to the function component (or function) will be 
    wrapped a single variable called props. Props are properties that we pass to a children compoent that we can
    access in the component using props variable.


function f(param1,param2){} //params 
f(arg1,arg2) //arguments

_________________________________________________________________

- If we have multiple props to pass and we have a data as an object, we can just use spready syntax to 
    to pass all properties at once.

[ React handles this internally ]In react,We keep the representation of DOM with us known as "Virtual DOM".
    - We need virtual dom in react for "reconcilliation"[ The process of syncing Virtual DOM with the real DOM.] 
     reconcilliation involves an algorithm that react uses
     to diff one DOM tree from another(Virtual DOM) which is also known as Diffing algorithm
     and it determines what needs to changed/unchanged in the UI.
    ]

    - reconcilliation : renders a component -> constructs virtual DOM -> Checks for changes btwn
                       DOM & V-DOM if there are any changes -> updates the specific changes -> rerenders the component 
- In React16, React-Fiber was introduced, which is a new reconcilliation engine. This new reconcilliation engine    
    is responsible for new diffing algorithm that improves the react and makes it faster.

Always prefer using a unique id as value for the key attribute in a list and avoid using index.
Using index might result in performance issues and data binding issues in case 
    reordering in the form of sorting, filtering might happen.
